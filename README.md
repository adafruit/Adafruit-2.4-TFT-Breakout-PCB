### DESCRIPTION
Add some jazz & pizzazz to your project with a color touchscreen LCD. This TFT display is 2.4" diagonal with a bright (4 white-LED) backlight and it's colorful! 240x320 pixels with individual RGB pixel control, this has way more resolution than a black and white 128x64 display.

As a bonus, this display has a resistive touchscreen attached to it already, so you can detect finger presses anywhere on the screen.

If you need a larger touchscreen, check out the 2.8" diagonal or 3.5" diagonal TFT breakouts. For a smaller display, see our non-touch 2.2" or 1.8" or 1.44" diagonal TFTs

This display has a controller built into it with RAM buffering, so that almost no work is done by the microcontroller. The display can be used in two modes: 8-bit or SPI. For 8-bit mode, you'll need 8 digital data lines and 4 or 5 digital control lines to read and write to the display (12 lines total). SPI mode requires only 5 pins total (SPI data in, data out, clock, select, and d/c) but is slower than 8-bit mode.

In addition, 4 pins are required for the touch screen (2 digital, 2 analog) or you can purchase and use our resistive touchscreen controller (not included) to use I2C or SPI.
